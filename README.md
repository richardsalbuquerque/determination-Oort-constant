# Determination of the Oort Constant

Starting from observational data from Gaia, we will determine the Oort constants A and B using
velocities perpendicular to the line of sight:

$v_t(l) = A d \cos(2l) + Bd$

where "d" is the distance from the star and "l" is its Galactic longitude. The steps are as follows:

(i)   Select a sample of around 400,000 stars from the Gaia catalog.

(ii)  Transform proper motion from equatorial coordinates to Galactic coordinates.

(iii) Plot a graph of v_t(l) for the stars very close to the Sun. Fit a function to 
get the speed of the Sun (u_0 , v_0 ) relative to the LSR.

(iv)  Plot the proper motions in longitude, already corrected for the speed of the Sun. Adjust
a function to get A and B.

(v)   Compare your rough estimates of A and B with recent results from the literature 
(e.g. Bovy, 2017; Li et al., 2019).
